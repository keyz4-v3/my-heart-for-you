                    I have soo much to say that I don't know where to start. It's been more than a year together and yet when I reminisce the golden moments we have spent together it feels so new and fresh as if hardly a day has passed by. It's so amusing how fast time flies. My journey with you has been soo very beautiful this far. From sitting by the lake, listing to our songs to staring at the brilliant night sky, with a sparkle in our eyes . From walking miles pretending to be friends to walking hand in hand even in front of your friends. From sharing a single plate to sharing the same smell. I can't wrap it all in words but I just want you to know how blessed this big boy feels when her little angel is by her side, whispering in his ears words of love and affection. Cheering him up when he's low and scolding him badly for unhealthy food. Ouch! I pray we stay the same, and grow together to be two silly cute creatures entangled beautifully in the thread of love. I lovee you honey. Always keep smilingðŸ’‹
